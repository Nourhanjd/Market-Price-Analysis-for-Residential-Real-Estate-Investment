#Market Price Analysis for Residential Real Estate Investment

## Project Overview

### Objective
The focus is on analyzing and predicting housing prices using various attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, among others.

### Scope of Work
The project involves completing a series of ten questions, each designed to guide the analysis towards an accurate prediction model for housing prices.

## Dataset Overview

### Source
The dataset for this assignment comprises house sale prices in King County, which includes the Seattle area. This dataset is particularly relevant as it represents a comprehensive snapshot of the residential real estate market in a major urban area.

### Timeframe
The dataset covers home sales from May 2014 to May 2015, providing a one-year window into the real estate market dynamics during that period.

### Modifications
It is important to note that the dataset has been slightly modified for the purposes of this course. These modifications are aimed at enhancing the learning experience and may include simplifications or additional challenges relevant to the course objectives.

### Key Features
The dataset includes several features that are critical in the real estate market, such as:
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of floors

These features, among others, will be pivotal in developing a model that can accurately predict house prices.

## Methodology

### Data Analysis
The initial phase of the project will involve a thorough analysis of the dataset. This will include data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to understand the underlying patterns and correlations between different variables.

### Model Development
Based on the insights gained from the data analysis, a predictive model will be developed. This model will aim to accurately forecast the market price of a house based on its features.

### Question Answering
The project is structured around answering ten specific questions, each contributing to a deeper understanding of the dataset and the predictive model. These questions will guide the analysis and ensure a comprehensive approach to the problem.

### Hints and Guidance
Throughout the project, hints and guidance provided in the template notebook will be utilized. These hints are designed to steer the analysis in the right direction and ensure all key aspects of the problem are addressed.

## Expected Outcomes

Upon completion of this project, the following outcomes are expected:
1. A clear understanding of the factors that influence residential property prices in King County.
2. A reliable predictive model for estimating house prices based on a set of features.
3. Detailed answers to the ten guided questions, each adding value to the overall analysis and understanding of the real estate market.

## Conclusion

This project represents a crucial step for the Real Estate Investment Trust in its venture into the residential real estate market. The insights and predictive model developed through this assignment will play a pivotal role in guiding the Trust's investment decisions.
